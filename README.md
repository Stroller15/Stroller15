# Hey! 👋🏼 I'm Shubham  

I'm a software engineer who loves building scalable applications and solving complex problems. When I'm not writing code, I enjoy talking with like-minded techies and playing chess and badminton. I primarily code in JavaScript/TypeScript, but I'm not limited to them. I also stay updated on AI advancements and experiment with multi-agent systems.
