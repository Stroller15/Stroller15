# hey! 👋🏼 i'm shubham  

i'm a software engineer who loves solving problems with code. when i'm not coding, i enjoy talking with like-minded techies and playing chess and badminton. i primarily code in javascript/typescript, but i'm not limited to them. i am curious about ai agents and web3 and am exploring their intersection to learn and build.
